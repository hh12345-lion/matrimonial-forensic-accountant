    title: "Senior involvement throughout",
    text: "Instructions are accepted by a senior forensic accountant and remain under their direct responsibility throughout, from initial review to expert report and oral testimony. Work is not delegated to a junior team.",
  },
  {
    title: "Independence above all else",
    text: "Our expert opinions reflect our honest view of the financial issues. We will advise solicitors promptly if our preliminary view is adverse to the instructing party, because early advice is always more useful than a late surprise.",
  },
  {
    title: "Clarity in every report",
    text: "We write for the judge who will read the report, not for the accountant who drafted it. Complex financial analysis must be made understandable: that is as much part of our job as the analysis itself.",
  },

    title: "Responsive to proceedings",
    text: "Litigation has timetables. We agree realistic timelines at the outset and communicate proactively if anything changes. Urgent preliminary assessments are available where proceedings require it.",
  },

  { step: "3", title: "Letter of instruction", text: "Review the instruction letter, raise queries if scope needs clarification. Confirm acceptance within 2 working days." },
  { step: "4", title: "Document review", text: "Receive and review all relevant financial documents. Request additional materials if needed." },
  { step: "5", title: "Analysis", text: "Conduct the forensic analysis, applying appropriate methodology, testing assumptions, identifying any matters outside our expertise." },
